# Geo Demographic Segmentation Model Using Artificial-Neural-Network


This is a project to build and implement Artificial Neural Network to predict which customer would "churn" from a fictitious dataset of a bank with geo demographic information. The objective is to build and use a Artificial Neural Network to train and measure the accuracy of the model in predicting which customer leaves the bank. The dataset is available at [Churn_data](https://github.com/Atheros167/Artificial-Neural-Network/blob/master/Churn_Modelling.csv)
The datafields included are
1. Customer Id
2. Last Name
3. Credit Scores
4. Geography - Three countries of France, Spain and Germany
5. Gender
6. Age
7. Tenure
8. Current Balance in the accounts
9. Number of products with the bank
10. Whether he/she has a credit card with the bank
11. Is he/she an active customer (last 2 months)
12 Estimated Salary

The Dependent variable is "Exited" - denoted whether the customer exited or not. 1 if he/she exited and 0 if not


The code for hte model is available [here](https://github.com/Atheros167/Artificial-Neural-Network/blob/master/Churn_Model_ANN.ipynb)
